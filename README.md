# Image-style-transfer
In this work, we show how the generic feature representations learned by high-performing Convolutional Neural Networks can be used to independently process and manipulate the content and the style of natural images. Conceptually, in the proposed algorithm, constrains a texture synthesis method by feature representations from state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks
